No structure freeze, model change, E6 run, held-out data, paper or simulation is in it.
- 2026-11-03 16:37 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:b016-records-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds records only (nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/): B016's item folder (README, results, metadata snapshots, item scripts, hand-offs), the generated backlog index, X030, D271, D272, Q38, STATUS and plied records (notes, P73/P74 states). No structure freeze, model change, E6 run, held-out data, paper or simulation is in it.
- 2026-11-03 16:40 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for merge:browser-sim-m1@f8d29d5: not-triggered — A local fast-forward of main (8bc7789) to browser-sim-m1 (f8d29d5): it adds no content beyond the 18 commits already on the branch, each of them gated when made (commit:synchrony-review-20261101 ... commit:b016-records-20261103), where the content this commitment governs was reviewed. Nothing is pushed or published by this step. No freeze, model change, run, held-out use or new reading is in it.
- 2026-11-05 05:07 UTC lead (session bd70e4eb): review for commit:q38-records-20261105: not-applicable — The commit holds records only (D273, D274, P187, T037's close, Q38's answer, node notes, STATUS, generated views, and D272's merge-gate dispositions); nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/. No food-state or clock comparison, proxy or new data.
- 2026-11-05 05:10 UTC lead (session bd70e4eb): reviewed D275@8a62e7098822; D275 cites D240/D242: food state and clock comparisons stay uncommissioned on these data; its new-data column is only for item 1(d), where P142 keeps them open
- 2026-11-05 05:20 UTC lead (session bd70e4eb): reviewed D275@332d2e843e26; D275's correction changes only its food-state wording (variation unknown, not absent; D276), which matches P142: no food-state comparison now, open for item 1(d)
- 2026-11-05 05:20 UTC lead (session bd70e4eb): review for commit:q39-records-20261105: not-applicable — Records-only commit (D275 as corrected, D276, Q39's answer, T063's close, T064 and P188-P197, node notes, STATUS, generated views); nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/, and nothing runs. No food-state or clock comparison, proxy or new data; D275 corrected to 'unknown, not absent' in line with it.
