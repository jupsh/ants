title: Wall behaviour and packing settled before any spatial coupling
wording: wall behaviour and packing settled before any spatial coupling
summary: >-
  Applies at Stages 1-3's gate (transmission members are a spatial coupling); whether wall and
  packing are settled (T009 closed, S001) is for that review.

  - action: run:q03-recheck-20261025
    disposition: not-applicable
    because: >-
      This run is the Q03 water-init recheck at C2 base (T015): no Stages 1-3 member, no mechanism,
      no spatial coupling, no assessment rows. Base runs add no spatial coupling.

    disposition: satisfied
    because: >-
      The transmission members are spatial couplings; D159 item 5 accepted P25's disposition for
      these bounded comparisons (settled = closed with failures accepted, P52).

## History
- 2026-10-25 00:28 UTC lead (session 7c2d50fd): created — T049 scan review (D144)
- 2026-10-25 04:10 UTC lead (session 0bcdd30b): reviewed D157: the redesign adds spatial members (transmission and a spatially varying shared response), so this precondition binds the revised design before any of them runs. Still open.
- 2026-10-25 04:14 UTC lead (session 0bcdd30b): added D158 to links — D158 puts this precondition to the user at the gate, proposing 'settled as a closed, disclosed limitation' (T009, F027, F078); undecided
- 2026-10-25 04:19 UTC lead (session 0bcdd30b): added D159 to links — the user accepted the disposition for these bounded diagnostic comparisons (D159 item 5): packing closed, its failures accepted as limitations, F078's occupancy and spread carried with the near-share deficit; recorded as the disposition at the Stage 2 gate
- 2026-10-25 04:25 UTC lead (session 0bcdd30b): reviewed D160: it designs the C2 warm-up recheck (D159 item 4), base only, with no spatial member; packing's disposition is untouched.
- 2026-10-25 16:45 UTC lead (session 421f3ea4): reviewed D161: it approves the Q03 recheck design (T015) and confirms Stage 1 may proceed now, Stage 2a after the recheck reading; it mentions T033 only for that order. Packing is not mentioned; P52's disposition stands.
- 2026-10-25 16:54 UTC lead (session 421f3ea4): review for run:q03-recheck-20261025: not-applicable — This run is the Q03 water-init recheck at C2 base (T015): no Stages 1-3 member, no mechanism, no spatial coupling, no assessment rows. Base runs add no spatial coupling.
- 2026-10-25 18:12 UTC lead (session fe835760): reviewed D163: a water-start recheck at C2 base; it says nothing about wall behaviour or packing (F078 still carried). Unaffected.
- 2026-10-25 18:24 UTC lead (session fe835760): reviewed D164: the build adds spatial coupling members but runs none for assessment; whether wall and packing are settled stays for the Stages 1-3 gate. Unaffected.
- 2026-10-26 01:19 UTC lead (session 0cf57b71): reviewed D165: it cites D158/D159 only for the forecast's timing; P25's disposition (accepted in D159, P52) is unchanged.
- 2026-10-26 01:27 UTC lead (session 0cf57b71): reviewed D166/D167: precision only; P25's disposition and its carried packing limits are untouched.
- 2026-10-26 01:31 UTC lead (session 0cf57b71): review for run:partd-bench-20261026: satisfied — The transmission members are spatial couplings; D159 item 5 accepted P25's disposition for these bounded comparisons (settled = closed with failures accepted, P52).
- 2026-10-26 02:38 UTC lead (session 0cf57b71): reviewed D169: cost basis only (via D158); packing disposition untouched.
- 2026-10-26 03:36 UTC lead (session 0cf57b71): reviewed D170/D171: no packing change; disposition as D159.
- 2026-10-26 03:38 UTC lead (session 0cf57b71): review for rent:partd2a-20261026: satisfied — D159 item 5 accepted P25's disposition for these comparisons (P52).
- 2026-10-26 16:07 UTC lead (session d6df3027): review for rent:partd2a-20261026-d172: satisfied — D159 item 5 accepted P25's disposition for these comparisons (P52); no change since.
- 2026-10-26 16:14 UTC lead (session d6df3027): review for rent:partd2a-20261026-56637446: satisfied — D159 item 5 accepted P25's disposition for these comparisons (P52); no change since.
- 2026-10-26 16:16 UTC lead (session d6df3027): review for run:partd2a: satisfied — D159 item 5 accepted P25's disposition for these comparisons (P52); no change since.
- 2026-10-29 01:26 UTC lead (session 20261029): reviewed D173-D175 (via D158/D159/T033): calibration and the capability/support rules do not touch wall behaviour or packing; P52 still states what 'settled' means for Stages 1-3. Unaffected.
- 2026-10-29 05:27 UTC lead (session 20261029): reviewed D176: a statistics build on the existing spatial members; no wall or packing change. Unaffected.
- 2026-10-29 05:32 UTC lead (session 20261029): reviewed D177: no wall or packing change. Unaffected.
- 2026-10-29 05:34 UTC lead (session 20261029): reviewed D178: no wall or packing change. Unaffected.
- 2026-10-29 05:37 UTC lead (session 20261029): review for rent:partd2b-20261029: satisfied — D159 item 5 accepted P25's disposition for these comparisons (P52); no packing change since.
- 2026-10-29 05:44 UTC lead (session 20261029): review for run:partd2b-20261029: satisfied — D159 item 5 / P52: packing closed with failures accepted for these comparisons; unchanged.
- 2026-10-29 14:49 UTC lead (session 20261029): review for rent:partd2b-switch-20261029: satisfied — Unchanged since run:partd2b-20261029: P52's disposition holds; no packing arm.
- 2026-10-29 21:23 UTC lead (session 20261029): review for commit:20261029: not-applicable — A commit adds no spatial coupling; P52's disposition for these comparisons is unchanged.
- 2026-10-29 21:47 UTC lead (session 20261029): review for run:partd2-capfiles: not-applicable — No simulation and no spatial coupling is added; the audits only measure existing runs.
- 2026-10-29 22:15 UTC lead (session 20261029): reviewed D185: P25/P52's disposition is carried as a disclosure in the 2b reader; unaffected
- 2026-10-29 22:36 UTC lead (session 20261029): review for run:partd2b-read: satisfied — P52's disposition is carried as a disclosure in the reading (D185); no spatial coupling added.
- 2026-10-30 04:50 UTC lead (session 9aa22476): review for run:t057-judge-20261030: not-applicable — Governs spatial coupling; the judge adds no spatial coupling (no oracle, no coupling arm)
- 2026-10-30 05:37 UTC lead (session 9d2b15e6): reviewed D194: D194 carries P52's meaning of 'settled' (closed with failures accepted, F078 with the near-share deficit) as a disclosure and adds no spatial coupling; the coupling arms were the ones gated at D158/D159. Unaffected.
- 2026-10-30 17:36 UTC lead (session 9d2b15e6): review for run:partdcap-nulls: not-applicable — nulls adds no spatial coupling; it computes c from base-arm runs only (D176)
- 2026-10-30 17:47 UTC lead (session 9d2b15e6): review for run:partdcap-same: not-applicable — the check adds no spatial coupling; it compares stored datasets of members already run (D176)
- 2026-10-30 17:56 UTC lead (session 9d2b15e6): review for run:partdcap-cross: not-applicable — cross adds no spatial coupling; it compares stored datasets of members already run (D176)
- 2026-10-30 17:58 UTC lead (session 9d2b15e6): reviewed D200: it cites D158 for Stage 3c; no spatial coupling added by the capability step. Unaffected.

- 2026-10-31 02:57 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-data: not-applicable — no spatial coupling added
- 2026-10-31 02:57 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-read: not-applicable — no spatial coupling added
- 2026-10-31 03:23 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-second: not-applicable — no spatial coupling
- 2026-10-31 03:34 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-second: not-applicable — re-read D226 after its change: the change appends D228's result only (the independent check agrees); the check was a reproduction on existing records, so this commitment still does not bear on it
- 2026-10-31 03:35 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for commit:partd-1b1c-20261031: not-applicable — no spatial coupling is added
- 2026-10-31 04:22 UTC lead (session 548cad34): reviewed D231@68d492443f36; D231 cites D158 only to name the members; it proposes no spatial coupling and no run, so P25's gate is not reached
- 2026-11-01 22:46 UTC lead (session f6ab21fd): review for commit:h6-design-20261101: not-triggered — The commit records the T061 inventory (D240), the H6 design and its amendment (D241), the user's answers (D242), F108's update and plied records; no model change, analysis, run or reading of new results.
- 2026-11-02 03:34 UTC lead (session 7b85e17e): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: not-triggered — The commit records T060's design (D243 with amendment 1), the user's answer (D244), STATUS's pointer and plied records only; nothing is built, run, fitted or read; no spatial coupling is added to the model.
- 2026-11-02 05:56 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): review for commit:h6-design-20261101: not-triggered — Re-read D241@36eec164deeb: since the 597483 bytes this review read (the bytes committed in f9ad78f), only two blocks were appended, the lead's implementation details (onset rule, 25 mm radius, S1 sampling, runs, queens) and amendment 2 (D246). The commit holds the version read, so this disposition for it stands; the additions are reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-02 15:34 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): review for commit:h6-design-20261101: not-triggered — Re-read D241@07a71b62d68a: one dated line appended under amendment 2 (D249: the blind check's cutoff is the user's, either pooled or either zone share above 50 %, one zone flag printed) (and, since the 597483/2b609a47 pins, the lead's implementation details and amendment 2, reviewed at 05:5x UTC). The commit holds the version first read (597483), so this disposition for it stands; the later text is reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-03 00:07 UTC lead (session eac59010): review for commit:h6-design-20261101: not-triggered — Re-read D241@b1dd437cb8eb: one dated line appended (D259: the reader frozen, reader.ts and extract.ts SHA-256s, committed under scripts/frozen/h6/); no change to the design, the rules or any amendment. The commit holds the version it was gated on; the later text is reviewed at the next commit's gate (commit:h6-freeze-20261102).
- 2026-11-03 01:00 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for commit:h6-reading-20261103: not-triggered — No spatial coupling is added to the model; nothing under src/ changes.
- 2026-11-03 01:08 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: not-triggered — Re-read D243@f25336a56aed: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 01:04 UTC, the lead's Stage 0 implementation details: order of two briefs, event table, near approach, triplets, matching cell, 0a, 0b likelihood and support, Scope A generator), filling gaps in amendment 1 without changing it. The commit (dca4a4a) holds the version read, so this disposition for it stands; the block is reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-03 02:22 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: not-triggered — Re-read D243@e11041360645: amendment 2 appended (D262: 0b read as k-bar over a memoryless reference's median; V0 cases b2 and a-sparse added). The commit (dca4a4a) holds the version first read, so this disposition for it stands; the later text is reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-03 07:02 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: not-triggered — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule. The commit (dca4a4a) holds the version first read, so this disposition for it stands; the block is reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-03 15:24 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: not-triggered — Re-read D243@ab96ad707023: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 15:18 UTC, the lead's details of the support-only audit after D266: a restricted support reader, the extraction in memory with no event table written, the colony-237 flag, the freeze, the stops). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 15:25 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-q37-records-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds records only (git status: nothing under src/, scripts/, test/ or .claude/; backlog/ left out): T060's Stage 0 records D261-D266 with D243's dated blocks, X029, STATUS, and plied records (Q36, Q37, P175-P183, dispositions, notes, T037's message). No structure freeze, model change, E6 run, held-out data, paper or simulation is in it.
- 2026-11-03 16:01 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: not-triggered — Re-read D243@a0ceb72f78ab: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03, the support audit's code frozen: support.ts, extract.ts and their 26-file import closure copied byte-identical under scripts/frozen/t060/ with their SHA-256s; P172, D267, D268). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 16:03 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-freeze-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds the T060 freeze and its records: scripts/frozen/t060/ (26 files, byte-identical to D243's freeze block SHA-256s; checked by sha256sum and by the frozen copy's colony-237 repro and synthetic pool, D243), D267, D268, D243's blocks, STATUS, and plied records (P184, P185, dispositions, notes). Nothing under src/ or test/; scripts/scratch/ and logs/ are not committed; backlog/ left out. No structure freeze, model change, E6 run, held-out data, paper or simulation is in it.
- 2026-11-03 16:28 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-close-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds records only (git status: nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/; backlog/ left out): the T060 reading D269, F117, D270, T060's close and its commitment states, P186, T063, notes, STATUS. No structure freeze, model change, E6 run, held-out data, paper or simulation is in it.
- 2026-11-03 16:37 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:b016-records-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds records only (nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/): B016's item folder (README, results, metadata snapshots, item scripts, hand-offs), the generated backlog index, X030, D271, D272, Q38, STATUS and plied records (notes, P73/P74 states). No structure freeze, model change, E6 run, held-out data, paper or simulation is in it.
- 2026-11-03 16:40 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for merge:browser-sim-m1@f8d29d5: not-triggered — A local fast-forward of main (8bc7789) to browser-sim-m1 (f8d29d5): it adds no content beyond the 18 commits already on the branch, each of them gated when made (commit:synchrony-review-20261101 ... commit:b016-records-20261103), where the content this commitment governs was reviewed. Nothing is pushed or published by this step. No freeze, model change, run, held-out use or new reading is in it.
- 2026-11-05 05:07 UTC lead (session bd70e4eb): review for commit:q38-records-20261105: not-applicable — The commit holds records only (D273, D274, P187, T037's close, Q38's answer, node notes, STATUS, generated views, and D272's merge-gate dispositions); nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/. No spatial coupling is introduced.
