wording: >-
  Keep (b), its pass disclosed as by support; add (b2) Weibull excess k = 0.7 (falling hazard,
  finite mean), acceptance 'established' in at most 5 %.

      1b adds b2 and labels (b)'s result as passing by support. Follow-up 1b changes the brief-1
      code for D243 amendment 2 and runs tests and a Scope A smoke (3 sets per case, plus b2,
      a-sparse, c-sparse) into logs/t060-synthetic/ only; no tracks, no H6 intermediates, no
      empirical output.

## History
- 2026-11-03 02:21 UTC lead (session f6353347): created — D262, point 2
- 2026-11-03 02:23 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for run:t060-s0-brief1b: acting — 1b adds b2 and labels (b)'s result as passing by support. Follow-up 1b changes the brief-1 code for D243 amendment 2 and runs tests and a Scope A smoke (3 sets per case, plus b2, a-sparse, c-sparse) into logs/t060-synthetic/ only; no tracks, no H6 intermediates, no empirical output.
- 2026-11-03 02:58 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for run:t060-v0-scopeA-20261103: acting — (b) runs and is reported as passing by support; b2 runs with its acceptance. The run is Scope A's V0 in full: scripts/scratch/t060/scopeA.ts --case all --sets 0:200 --par 10, fully synthetic event tables (only roles() ant counts read), output under logs/t060-synthetic/v0A; code as checked in D263 (reader.ts 01d574a3, scopeA.ts ca53b396).
- 2026-11-03 06:53 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-s0-brief2: satisfied — (b) and (b2) are in scopeA.ts (D263) and running in V0; brief 2 does not change them. Brief 2's runs: T060 tests, tsc, npm test, a Scope A determinism check and a Scope B smoke (synthetic, logs/t060-synthetic/ only), and the reproduction mode on real tracks, which builds event tables in memory and prints or writes only the reproduction values and the speed-bound shares (logs/t060-repro/).
- 2026-11-03 07:02 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-s0-brief1b: acting — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule. It was appended after this run ended (D261, D263); the run was made against the version read, so this disposition stands. The block is gated under run:t060-s0-brief2.
- 2026-11-03 07:02 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-v0-scopeA-20261103: acting — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule. The running Scope A V0 (synthetic event tables; reader.ts 01d574a3, scopeA.ts ca53b396) uses none of it, so this disposition stands.
- 2026-11-03 09:03 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): set state=fulfilled; set resolved_by=D264 — D264: (b) ran in V0 and is reported as passing by support (0/200, all by support); (b2) ran with its rule, 0/200 established
