      support.ts --pool on the synthetic Scope B support files (compared with the scratch pool). No
      audit on tracks, no event table written, the sealed folder never named. Nothing it governs is
      computed or read.

      The commit holds the T060 freeze and its records: scripts/frozen/t060/ (26 files,
      byte-identical to D243's freeze block SHA-256s; checked by sha256sum and by the frozen copy's
      colony-237 repro and synthetic pool, D243), D267, D268, D243's blocks, STATUS, and plied
      records (P184, P185, dispositions, notes). Nothing under src/ or test/; scripts/scratch/ and
      logs/ are not committed; backlog/ left out. No audit result yet.

    disposition: acting

      The run is the support-only audit (D266, D267): the frozen scripts/frozen/t060/ support.ts
      --colony i for the 22 colonies (extraction in memory, no event table written, only whitelisted
      counts to logs/t060-support/), then --pool. The sealed folder is never named or written.
      Applied at the reading: back to the user if the primary or any sensitivity would pass;
      otherwise T060 closes.

- 2026-11-03 15:52 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-freeze-check: not-triggered — Checking that the frozen copy under scripts/frozen/t060/ runs: frozen extract.ts --colony 15 --repro (reproduction values only, compared with cmp to D265's repro-c15.json) and frozen support.ts --pool on the synthetic Scope B support files (compared with the scratch pool). No audit on tracks, no event table written, the sealed folder never named. Nothing it governs is computed or read.
