      The brief tells the implementer to stop and report any failed check or needed design change
      rather than adapt; the lead brings it to the user. Brief 1 runs only tests and a Scope A smoke
      on fully synthetic event tables (3 data sets per case) into logs/t060-synthetic/; it reads no
      tracks and no H6 intermediate, only roles() metadata for ant counts.

      determinism check and a Scope B smoke (synthetic, logs/t060-synthetic/ only), and the
      reproduction mode on real tracks, which builds event tables in memory and prints or writes
      only the reproduction values and the speed-bound shares (logs/t060-repro/).

## History
- 2026-11-02 03:29 UTC lead (session 7b85e17e): created — D244 effect: as D242 for H6
- 2026-11-02 03:35 UTC lead (session 7b85e17e): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: not-triggered — No check has run.
- 2026-11-03 01:00 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for commit:h6-reading-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds the H6 reading (D260), F113-F116 and record notes only (git diff: nothing under src/, scripts/, test/ or .claude/); no Stage 0 code, run or output exists or is committed, and T060's design is unchanged.
- 2026-11-03 01:05 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for run:t060-s0-brief1: acting — The brief tells the implementer to stop and report any failed check or needed design change rather than adapt; the lead brings it to the user. Brief 1 runs only tests and a Scope A smoke on fully synthetic event tables (3 data sets per case) into logs/t060-synthetic/; it reads no tracks and no H6 intermediate, only roles() metadata for ant counts.
- 2026-11-03 01:08 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: not-triggered — Re-read D243@f25336a56aed: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 01:04 UTC, the lead's Stage 0 implementation details: order of two briefs, event table, near approach, triplets, matching cell, 0a, 0b likelihood and support, Scope A generator), filling gaps in amendment 1 without changing it. The commit (dca4a4a) holds the version read, so this disposition for it stands; the block is reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-03 01:29 UTC lead (session f6353347): reviewed D261@23cebf2e477f; D261 acts on P166: the two design problems (case b, small-cell bias) go to the user as Q36; nothing runs on T060 until the answer. Stays open
- 2026-11-03 02:22 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: not-triggered — Re-read D243@e11041360645: amendment 2 appended (D262: 0b read as k-bar over a memoryless reference's median; V0 cases b2 and a-sparse added). The commit (dca4a4a) holds the version first read, so this disposition for it stands; the later text is reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-03 02:23 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for run:t060-s0-brief1b: acting — D261's problems went to the user (Q36) and were answered (D262); the follow-up tells the implementer to stop and report any further failure. Follow-up 1b changes the brief-1 code for D243 amendment 2 and runs tests and a Scope A smoke (3 sets per case, plus b2, a-sparse, c-sparse) into logs/t060-synthetic/ only; no tracks, no H6 intermediates, no empirical output.
- 2026-11-03 02:58 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for run:t060-v0-scopeA-20261103: acting — A failed acceptance rule goes to the user before anything else. The run is Scope A's V0 in full: scripts/scratch/t060/scopeA.ts --case all --sets 0:200 --par 10, fully synthetic event tables (only roles() ant counts read), output under logs/t060-synthetic/v0A; code as checked in D263 (reader.ts 01d574a3, scopeA.ts ca53b396).
- 2026-11-03 06:53 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-s0-brief2: acting — The brief says a failed check or a design gap comes back in the report, not worked around; settings and thresholds are not adjusted. Brief 2's runs: T060 tests, tsc, npm test, a Scope A determinism check and a Scope B smoke (synthetic, logs/t060-synthetic/ only), and the reproduction mode on real tracks, which builds event tables in memory and prints or writes only the reproduction values and the speed-bound shares (logs/t060-repro/).
- 2026-11-03 07:01 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: not-triggered — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule. The commit (dca4a4a) holds the version first read, so this disposition for it stands; the block is reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-03 07:01 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-s0-brief1b: acting — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule. It was appended after this run ended (D261, D263); the run was made against the version read, so this disposition stands. The block is gated under run:t060-s0-brief2.
- 2026-11-03 07:01 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-v0-scopeA-20261103: acting — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule. The running Scope A V0 (synthetic event tables; reader.ts 01d574a3, scopeA.ts ca53b396) uses none of it, so this disposition stands.
- 2026-11-03 09:03 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): reviewed D265@78ad4ca2f334; D265 acts on it: Scope B's rules fail for a reason in the design; nothing adjusted; brought to the user as Q37
- 2026-11-03 15:23 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: not-triggered — Re-read D243@ab96ad707023: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 15:18 UTC, the lead's details of the support-only audit after D266: a restricted support reader, the extraction in memory with no event table written, the colony-237 flag, the freeze, the stops). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 15:23 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-s0-brief1b: acting — Re-read D243@ab96ad707023: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 15:18 UTC, the lead's details of the support-only audit after D266: a restricted support reader, the extraction in memory with no event table written, the colony-237 flag, the freeze, the stops). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (acting) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 15:23 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-s0-brief2: acting — Re-read D243@ab96ad707023: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 15:18 UTC, the lead's details of the support-only audit after D266: a restricted support reader, the extraction in memory with no event table written, the colony-237 flag, the freeze, the stops).

It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (acting) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 15:25 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-q37-records-20261103: satisfied — The commit holds records only (git status: nothing under src/, scripts/, test/ or .claude/; backlog/ left out): T060's Stage 0 records D261-D266 with D243's dated blocks, X029, STATUS, and plied records (Q36, Q37, P175-P183, dispositions, notes, T037's message). Scope B's failure (D265) came back to the user as Q37, answered in D266.
- 2026-11-03 15:30 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-support-brief: not-triggered — The run is the implementer's build of the restricted support reader and audit CLI (brief logs/handoff/20261103-1529-t060-support/brief.md): tests, tsc, the support reader on synthetic Scope A/B tables, and one extract.ts --repro on colony 237 (reproduction values only). The audit is not run on tracks; no event table from tracks is written; the sealed folder is never named. No failed check yet; the brief says any failure or needed change comes back in the report.
- 2026-11-03 15:42 UTC lead (session e38b977a): reviewed D267@decac8e6aabd; D267 names P166 only as the route for a failed check: if equality, whitelist or the colony-237 reproduction fails, nothing is frozen and it comes back to the user. The commitment stands unchanged.
- 2026-11-03 15:52 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-freeze-check: acting — Checking that the frozen copy under scripts/frozen/t060/ runs: frozen extract.ts --colony 15 --repro (reproduction values only, compared with cmp to D265's repro-c15.json) and frozen support.ts --pool on the synthetic Scope B support files (compared with the scratch pool). No audit on tracks, no event table written, the sealed folder never named. If the frozen copy fails to reproduce, nothing is committed or run and it comes back to the user.
- 2026-11-03 16:01 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: not-triggered — Re-read D243@a0ceb72f78ab: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03, the support audit's code frozen: support.ts, extract.ts and their 26-file import closure copied byte-identical under scripts/frozen/t060/ with their SHA-256s; P172, D267, D268). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.

Nothing under src/ or test/; scripts/scratch/ and logs/ are not committed; backlog/ left out. Scope B's failure (D265) came back to the user as Q37, answered in D266.
