## History
- 2026-11-02 15:27 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): created — D249: the user's rule for preserving frozen code
- 2026-11-02 15:30 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): review for run:h6-zoneflag-20261102: not-triggered — No freeze
- 2026-11-02 15:30 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): review for run:h6-v1v4-20261102: not-triggered — No freeze; the reader is copied under scripts/frozen/ at the freeze
- 2026-11-02 15:37 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): review for run:h6-blindcheck-20261102: not-triggered — No freeze
- 2026-11-02 15:40 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): reviewed D251@cf9244d69620; D251 cites D249 only for the blind-check cutoff; the freeze (and so this copy) waits on Q34; unchanged
- 2026-11-02 15:59 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): reviewed D252@cdcd4ef34d7e; D252 cites D249 only for the cutoff; the freeze's frozen copy will include the reachability extractor; unchanged
- 2026-11-02 16:01 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): review for run:h6-reach-20261102: not-triggered — No freeze
- 2026-11-02 16:55 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): review for run:h6-blindcheck2-20261102: not-triggered — No freeze
- 2026-11-02 16:57 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): reviewed D256@18f3534436d2; D256 cites D249 only for the cutoff; the extractor to copy at the freeze is h6-next's (reachability)
- 2026-11-02 22:01 UTC lead (session eac59010): reviewed D257@0a64c040066c; D257 read: names the files to freeze (reader.ts 3c3985c0, extract.ts ea889e9d) under scripts/frozen/; no freeze yet, stays open
- 2026-11-03 00:08 UTC lead (session eac59010): reviewed D258@81f3dbbbcece; Reviewed D258: the H6 freeze follows this commitment (D259, 24 files byte-identical under scripts/frozen/h6/, hashes in the log); it stays open for later freezes (T060)
- 2026-11-03 00:08 UTC lead (session eac59010): review for commit:h6-freeze-20261102: satisfied — This commit adds scripts/frozen/h6/: the frozen reader and every file it imports (24 files), each byte-identical to the SHA-256 listed in D259, checked file by file
- 2026-11-03 00:10 UTC lead (session eac59010): review for commit:h6-freeze-20261102: satisfied — Re-read D259@8bc940ad09b0: one dated line appended after the commit (committed as fb6af11, then the H6 output folder unsealed); the frozen files and hashes are unchanged, so the disposition for this commit stands
- 2026-11-03 00:30 UTC lead (session eac59010): review for run:h6-reading-20261103: satisfied — The reader run is the committed frozen copy (D259, fb6af11), byte-identical to the logged SHA-256s
- 2026-11-03 00:35 UTC lead (session eac59010): review for run:h6-reading2-20261103: satisfied — As for run:h6-reading-20261103, which died of heap exhaustion before writing anything: the same frozen reader, inputs and options, rerun with Node's heap raised to 6000 MB (no change to code or results)
- 2026-11-03 01:00 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for commit:h6-reading-20261103: not-triggered — No freeze in this commit: git diff HEAD shows nothing under scripts/frozen/ (H6's frozen copy, committed in fb6af11, unchanged); the reading ran from that copy (D260 'What ran').
- 2026-11-03 01:05 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for run:t060-s0-brief1: not-triggered — No freeze in brief 1. Brief 1 runs only tests and a Scope A smoke on fully synthetic event tables (3 data sets per case) into logs/t060-synthetic/; it reads no tracks and no H6 intermediate, only roles() metadata for ant counts.
- 2026-11-03 02:23 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for run:t060-s0-brief1b: not-triggered — No freeze. Follow-up 1b changes the brief-1 code for D243 amendment 2 and runs tests and a Scope A smoke (3 sets per case, plus b2, a-sparse, c-sparse) into logs/t060-synthetic/ only; no tracks, no H6 intermediates, no empirical output.
- 2026-11-03 02:58 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for run:t060-v0-scopeA-20261103: not-triggered — No freeze. The run is Scope A's V0 in full: scripts/scratch/t060/scopeA.ts --case all --sets 0:200 --par 10, fully synthetic event tables (only roles() ant counts read), output under logs/t060-synthetic/v0A; code as checked in D263 (reader.ts 01d574a3, scopeA.ts ca53b396).
- 2026-11-03 06:53 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-s0-brief2: not-triggered — No freeze happens in brief 2. Brief 2's runs: T060 tests, tsc, npm test, a Scope A determinism check and a Scope B smoke (synthetic, logs/t060-synthetic/ only), and the reproduction mode on real tracks, which builds event tables in memory and prints or writes only the reproduction values and the speed-bound shares (logs/t060-repro/).
- 2026-11-03 07:02 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-s0-brief1b: not-triggered — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule. It was appended after this run ended (D261, D263); the run was made against the version read, so this disposition stands. The block is gated under run:t060-s0-brief2.
- 2026-11-03 07:02 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-v0-scopeA-20261103: not-triggered — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule. The running Scope A V0 (synthetic event tables; reader.ts 01d574a3, scopeA.ts ca53b396) uses none of it, so this disposition stands.
- 2026-11-03 15:23 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-s0-brief1b: not-triggered — Re-read D243@ab96ad707023: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 15:18 UTC, the lead's details of the support-only audit after D266: a restricted support reader, the extraction in memory with no event table written, the colony-237 flag, the freeze, the stops). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 15:23 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-s0-brief2: not-triggered — Re-read D243@ab96ad707023: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 15:18 UTC, the lead's details of the support-only audit after D266: a restricted support reader, the extraction in memory with no event table written, the colony-237 flag, the freeze, the stops). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 15:23 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-v0-scopeA-20261103: not-triggered — Re-read D243@ab96ad707023: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 15:18 UTC, the lead's details of the support-only audit after D266: a restricted support reader, the extraction in memory with no event table written, the colony-237 flag, the freeze, the stops). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 15:25 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-q37-records-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds records only (git status: nothing under src/, scripts/, test/ or .claude/; backlog/ left out): T060's Stage 0 records D261-D266 with D243's dated blocks, X029, STATUS, and plied records (Q36, Q37, P175-P183, dispositions, notes, T037's message). No freeze in this commit; the audit's freeze under scripts/frozen/t060/ comes before its run, in its own commit.
- 2026-11-03 15:30 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-support-brief: not-triggered — The run is the implementer's build of the restricted support reader and audit CLI (brief logs/handoff/20261103-1529-t060-support/brief.md): tests, tsc, the support reader on synthetic Scope A/B tables, and one extract.ts --repro on colony 237 (reproduction values only). The audit is not run on tracks; no event table from tracks is written; the sealed folder is never named. No freeze in this run; the freeze of extract.ts, support.ts and their imports comes after the lead's check, before the audit.
- 2026-11-03 15:42 UTC lead (session e38b977a): reviewed D267@decac8e6aabd; D267 approves the gated commit of the T060 freeze (extract.ts, support.ts and every import under scripts/frozen/t060/, SHA-256s in D243) before the audit, once the checks pass; this is how P172 will be met for T060. Not yet fulfilled.
- 2026-11-03 15:52 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-freeze-check: acting — Checking that the frozen copy under scripts/frozen/t060/ runs: frozen extract.ts --colony 15 --repro (reproduction values only, compared with cmp to D265's repro-c15.json) and frozen support.ts --pool on the synthetic Scope B support files (compared with the scratch pool). No audit on tracks, no event table written, the sealed folder never named. This checks the copy made for P172 (26 files, byte-identical, SHA-256s to go in D243) before its commit.
- 2026-11-03 16:01 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-s0-brief1b: not-triggered — Re-read D243@a0ceb72f78ab: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03, the support audit's code frozen: support.ts, extract.ts and their 26-file import closure copied byte-identical under scripts/frozen/t060/ with their SHA-256s; P172, D267, D268). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 16:01 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-s0-brief2: not-triggered — Re-read D243@a0ceb72f78ab: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03, the support audit's code frozen: support.ts, extract.ts and their 26-file import closure copied byte-identical under scripts/frozen/t060/ with their SHA-256s; P172, D267, D268). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 16:01 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-support-brief: not-triggered — Re-read D243@a0ceb72f78ab: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03, the support audit's code frozen: support.ts, extract.ts and their 26-file import closure copied byte-identical under scripts/frozen/t060/ with their SHA-256s; P172, D267, D268). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 16:01 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-v0-scopeA-20261103: not-triggered — Re-read D243@a0ceb72f78ab: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03, the support audit's code frozen: support.ts, extract.ts and their 26-file import closure copied byte-identical under scripts/frozen/t060/ with their SHA-256s; P172, D267, D268). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 16:03 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-freeze-20261103: satisfied — The commit holds the T060 freeze and its records: scripts/frozen/t060/ (26 files, byte-identical to D243's freeze block SHA-256s; checked by sha256sum and by the frozen copy's colony-237 repro and synthetic pool, D243), D267, D268, D243's blocks, STATUS, and plied records (P184, P185, dispositions, notes). Nothing under src/ or test/; scripts/scratch/ and logs/ are not committed; backlog/ left out. This is P172 for T060: the frozen support reader, the extraction and every file they import, committed byte-identical under scripts/frozen/t060/, SHA-256s in D243.
- 2026-11-03 16:06 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-support-audit-20261103: satisfied — The run is the support-only audit (D266, D267): the frozen scripts/frozen/t060/ support.ts --colony i for the 22 colonies (extraction in memory, no event table written, only whitelisted counts to logs/t060-support/), then --pool. The sealed folder is never named or written. The run uses the copies committed byte-identical under scripts/frozen/t060/ (0e13c45, SHA-256s in D243).
- 2026-11-03 16:28 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-close-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds records only (git status: nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/; backlog/ left out): the T060 reading D269, F117, D270, T060's close and its commitment states, P186, T063, notes, STATUS. No freeze in this commit (T060's freeze was committed in 0e13c45).
- 2026-11-03 16:37 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:b016-records-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds records only (nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/): B016's item folder (README, results, metadata snapshots, item scripts, hand-offs), the generated backlog index, X030, D271, D272, Q38, STATUS and plied records (notes, P73/P74 states). No freeze.
