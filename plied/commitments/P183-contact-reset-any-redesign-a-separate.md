title: "Contact-reset: any redesign a separate decision"
wording: Any redesign should remain a separate decision.

state: open
nodes: [T060, T023]
reviews:
  - action: commit:t060-q37-records-20261103
    disposition: not-triggered
    because: >-
      The commit holds records only (git status: nothing under src/, scripts/, test/ or .claude/;
      backlog/ left out): T060's Stage 0 records D261-D266 with D243's dated blocks, X029, STATUS,
      and plied records (Q36, Q37, P175-P183, dispositions, notes, T037's message). No audit result
      exists yet; the commit records the decision (D266) and the lead's details only.

  - action: run:t060-support-brief
    disposition: not-triggered
    because: >-
      The run is the implementer's build of the restricted support reader and audit CLI (brief
      logs/handoff/20261103-1529-t060-support/brief.md): tests, tsc, the support reader on synthetic
      Scope A/B tables, and one extract.ts --repro on colony 237 (reproduction values only). The
      audit is not run on tracks; no event table from tracks is written; the sealed folder is never
      named. No redesign.

      support.ts --pool on the synthetic Scope B support files (compared with the scratch pool). No

      computed or read.

      code frozen: support.ts, extract.ts and their 26-file import closure copied byte-identical
      under scripts/frozen/t060/ with their SHA-256s; P172, D267, D268). It postdates this action
      and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the
      block is reviewed at the next action's gate.

      the 18 commits already on the branch, each of them gated when made
      (commit:synchrony-review-20261101 ... commit:b016-records-20261103), where the content this
      commitment governs was reviewed. Nothing is pushed or published by this step. No freeze, model

## History
- 2026-11-03 15:18 UTC lead (session e38b977a): created — D266: the user's answer to Q37
- 2026-11-03 15:26 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-q37-records-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds records only (git status: nothing under src/, scripts/, test/ or .claude/; backlog/ left out): T060's Stage 0 records D261-D266 with D243's dated blocks, X029, STATUS, and plied records (Q36, Q37, P175-P183, dispositions, notes, T037's message). No audit result exists yet; the commit records the decision (D266) and the lead's details only.
- 2026-11-03 15:30 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-support-brief: not-triggered — The run is the implementer's build of the restricted support reader and audit CLI (brief logs/handoff/20261103-1529-t060-support/brief.md): tests, tsc, the support reader on synthetic Scope A/B tables, and one extract.ts --repro on colony 237 (reproduction values only). The audit is not run on tracks; no event table from tracks is written; the sealed folder is never named. No redesign.
- 2026-11-03 15:52 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-freeze-check: not-triggered — Checking that the frozen copy under scripts/frozen/t060/ runs: frozen extract.ts --colony 15 --repro (reproduction values only, compared with cmp to D265's repro-c15.json) and frozen support.ts --pool on the synthetic Scope B support files (compared with the scratch pool). No audit on tracks, no event table written, the sealed folder never named. Nothing it governs is computed or read.
- 2026-11-03 16:01 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-support-brief: not-triggered — Re-read D243@a0ceb72f78ab: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03, the support audit's code frozen: support.ts, extract.ts and their 26-file import closure copied byte-identical under scripts/frozen/t060/ with their SHA-256s; P172, D267, D268). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (not-triggered) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 16:03 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-freeze-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds the T060 freeze and its records: scripts/frozen/t060/ (26 files, byte-identical to D243's freeze block SHA-256s; checked by sha256sum and by the frozen copy's colony-237 repro and synthetic pool, D243), D267, D268, D243's blocks, STATUS, and plied records (P184, P185, dispositions, notes). Nothing under src/ or test/; scripts/scratch/ and logs/ are not committed; backlog/ left out. No audit result exists yet; the commit records the decision (D266) and the lead's details only.
- 2026-11-03 16:06 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for run:t060-support-audit-20261103: not-triggered — The run is the support-only audit (D266, D267): the frozen scripts/frozen/t060/ support.ts --colony i for the 22 colonies (extraction in memory, no event table written, only whitelisted counts to logs/t060-support/), then --pool. The sealed folder is never named or written. No redesign.
- 2026-11-03 16:15 UTC lead (session e38b977a): added T023 to nodes — T060 closes (D269); a redesign would start under T023, so the commitment stays open and applies there too
- 2026-11-03 16:28 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-close-20261103: satisfied — The commit holds records only (git status: nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/; backlog/ left out): the T060 reading D269, F117, D270, T060's close and its commitment states, P186, T063, notes, STATUS. No redesign is opened; T060 closes and T063 is an assessment, not a redesign of T060's analysis (D270).
- 2026-11-03 16:37 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:b016-records-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds records only (nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/): B016's item folder (README, results, metadata snapshots, item scripts, hand-offs), the generated backlog index, X030, D271, D272, Q38, STATUS and plied records (notes, P73/P74 states). No redesign of T060.
- 2026-11-03 16:40 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for merge:browser-sim-m1@f8d29d5: not-triggered — A local fast-forward of main (8bc7789) to browser-sim-m1 (f8d29d5): it adds no content beyond the 18 commits already on the branch, each of them gated when made (commit:synchrony-review-20261101 ... commit:b016-records-20261103), where the content this commitment governs was reviewed. Nothing is pushed or published by this step. No freeze, model change, run, held-out use or new reading is in it.
- 2026-11-05 05:07 UTC lead (session bd70e4eb): review for commit:q38-records-20261105: not-applicable — The commit holds records only (D273, D274, P187, T037's close, Q38's answer, node notes, STATUS, generated views, and D272's merge-gate dispositions); nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/. No contact-reset redesign.
- 2026-11-05 05:10 UTC lead (session bd70e4eb): reviewed D275@8a62e7098822; D275 notes that reopening the contact routes would be a new design (P183) and offers it only as a Q39 option for the user
- 2026-11-05 05:19 UTC lead (session bd70e4eb): reviewed D275@332d2e843e26; D275's correction changes only its food-state wording (variation unknown, not absent; D276); no contact-reset redesign is chosen (D276 chose option 1)
- 2026-11-05 05:20 UTC lead (session bd70e4eb): review for commit:q39-records-20261105: not-applicable — Records-only commit (D275 as corrected, D276, Q39's answer, T063's close, T064 and P188-P197, node notes, STATUS, generated views); nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/, and nothing runs. No contact-reset redesign.
