title: New simulations or experiments only through a separate design
wording: consider new simulations or experiments through a separate design.

      D207 simulates nothing and uses no new experiment: it reads existing data and stored runs; new
      simulations stay for a separate design

- 2026-10-30 21:22 UTC lead (session 20261030): review for run:partdblocks-2: satisfied — simulates nothing and uses no new experiment; existing data and stored runs only
- 2026-10-30 21:23 UTC lead (session 20261030): review for run:partdblocks: not-applicable — re-read after D207's amendment: this run crashed (the machine ran out of memory) before writing any output, and nothing was read; the work is rerun under run:partdblocks-2, disposed separately
- 2026-10-30 21:33 UTC lead (session 20261030): review for run:partdblocks-3: satisfied — simulates nothing; existing data and stored runs only
- 2026-10-30 21:34 UTC lead (session 20261030): review for run:partdblocks-2: not-applicable — re-read after D207 amendment 2: this run's output failed P88's self-check and was set aside unread (blocks-selfcheck-failed-c91854ee.json); the work is rerun under run:partdblocks-3, disposed separately

- 2026-10-30 21:57 UTC lead (session 20261030): reviewed D210: it simulated nothing; its Next leaves new simulations or experiments to their own design; stays open
- 2026-10-30 22:07 UTC lead (session 108deea8): review for commit:partd-1a-20261030: satisfied — The commit holds no new simulation or experiment; D210's Next leaves new runs to their own design (P87).
- 2026-10-30 22:14 UTC lead (session 108deea8): reviewed D211@c8f5e94149d3; D211: 1(b) uses existing development data and needs no new simulation; 1(d) and 1(e) stay separate designs. Respected, still open
- 2026-10-30 22:42 UTC lead (session 108deea8): review for run:triggers-build-smoke: satisfied — No new simulation or experiment: existing recorded tracks only, under its own design (D212 amendment 1, approved D213).
- 2026-10-31 00:20 UTC lead (session 108deea8): review for run:triggers-build-smoke: satisfied — Re-read D212 after amendment 2: the amendment was written after this step finished, from its report (D215); it changes nothing the build or smoke did. The step is complete.
- 2026-10-31 00:20 UTC lead (session 108deea8): review for run:triggers-amend2: satisfied — No new simulation or experiment: synthetic checks and recorded tracks under D212 amendment 2 (D216).
- 2026-10-31 00:37 UTC lead (session 108deea8): review for run:triggers-cal-full: satisfied — No new simulation or experiment: synthetic calibration and recorded tracks, under D212 amendments 1-2 (D213, D216).
- 2026-10-31 00:41 UTC lead (session 108deea8): review for run:triggers-quorum: satisfied — No new simulation or experiment; synthetic test inputs under D219's design.
- 2026-10-31 00:42 UTC lead (session 108deea8): review for commit:item1b-design-20261031: satisfied — D212 and D219 are separate designs; no new simulation or experiment in the committed records.
- 2026-10-31 00:59 UTC lead (session 108deea8): review for commit:item1b-design-20261031: satisfied — Re-read D212 after its dated correction (D220): it only renames amendment 2's pooled-variance formula as its square root, the pooled SD both implementations compute; it changes nothing this action did or its disposition rests on.
- 2026-10-31 00:59 UTC lead (session 108deea8): review for run:triggers-amend2: satisfied — Re-read D212 after its dated correction (D220): it only renames amendment 2's pooled-variance formula as its square root, the pooled SD both implementations compute; it changes nothing this action did or its disposition rests on.

- 2026-10-31 01:00 UTC lead (session 108deea8): review for run:triggers-read: satisfied — No new simulation or experiment; the read aggregates the approved design's outputs.
- 2026-10-31 01:11 UTC lead (session 108deea8): reviewed D221@2c4c00f83034; D221's Next: a queen-linked model mechanism would be a separate design. Still open
- 2026-10-31 02:18 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): reviewed D222@1bbe791636e9, D223@b738f2de5839; D222 says model changes need their own design (recorded separately as P103, cf. P87); D223 re-reads existing tracks and runs, simulates nothing, and leaves B005's model side to a separate design. P87 stays open
- 2026-10-31 02:32 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): reviewed D223@d91126ff338b; D223 amendment 1 adds no simulation or experiment (the unseen-as-unknown sensitivity is data only, re-read tracks). Open
- 2026-10-31 02:33 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-build-smoke: satisfied — no new simulation or experiment: existing development tracks and stored runs re-read (D223 Inputs)
- 2026-10-31 02:57 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-data: satisfied — no new simulation or experiment: existing tracks and stored runs (D223 Inputs, D225)
- 2026-10-31 02:57 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-read: satisfied — no new simulation or experiment: existing tracks and stored runs (D223 Inputs, D225)
- 2026-10-31 03:23 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-second: satisfied — D227: existing minute records of two colonies and stored runs; no new simulation or experiment
- 2026-10-31 03:34 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-second: satisfied — re-read D226 after its change (appends D228's result only): the check used existing minute records and stored runs; no new simulation or experiment
- 2026-10-31 03:35 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for commit:partd-1b1c-20261031: satisfied — the committed work used existing tracks and stored runs; no new simulation or experiment
- 2026-10-31 04:22 UTC lead (session 548cad34): reviewed D232@7e78fcc5a5c3; D232 lists P87 under Not in scope and classes any prediction checkable in existing data as needing its own design; respected
- 2026-11-01 17:38 UTC lead (session f6ab21fd): reviewed D237@aeef03977adf; D237 read: the review runs nothing and changes no model; any check it proposes needs its own design. No change.
- 2026-11-01 18:21 UTC lead (session f6ab21fd): reviewed D237@2e84a192f41d, D238@7655ef093c1f; D237 (corrected) and D238 read: every proposed check needs its own design; nothing run or changed. No change.
- 2026-11-01 19:12 UTC lead (session f6ab21fd): reviewed D239@a5d3879fe9c2, D240@5875f9598246; D239 and D240 read: no change here (D240 is the T061 inventory; D239 starts T059 and T061).
- 2026-11-02 05:57 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): reviewed D232@5c00fbac6f47; D232 classes existing-data discriminators as needing their own design (P87); H6 is such a separate design (D241, T059), so this commitment is being followed, not changed
- 2026-11-03 16:41 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for merge:browser-sim-m1@f8d29d5: not-triggered — A local fast-forward of main (8bc7789) to browser-sim-m1 (f8d29d5): it adds no content beyond the 18 commits already on the branch, each of them gated when made (commit:synchrony-review-20261101 ... commit:b016-records-20261103), where the content this commitment governs was reviewed. Nothing is pushed or published by this step. No freeze, model change, run, held-out use or new reading is in it.
- 2026-11-05 05:10 UTC lead (session bd70e4eb): reviewed D275@8a62e7098822; D275 recommends a design brought for approval before anything runs (P87); nothing is simulated
- 2026-11-05 05:19 UTC lead (session bd70e4eb): reviewed D275@332d2e843e26, D276@78ee97edd611; D275's correction changes only its food-state wording (variation unknown, not absent; D276). D276 requires the 1(e) design back before implementation or runs (P188), consistent with P87
