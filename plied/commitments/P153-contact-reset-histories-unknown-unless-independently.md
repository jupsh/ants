title: "Contact-reset: histories unknown unless independently bounded"
wording: >-
  These histories must remain unknown unless independently bounded; reporting their counts does not
  make them complete.

state: open
nodes: [T060]

  - action: commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102
    disposition: satisfied
    because: >-
      D243 amendment 1, point 1: unbracketed partner gaps and unseen ants make a history unknown
      unless permitted metadata show the ant absent; counts never make it complete. Nothing is
      extracted yet.

      The brief requires every unknown cause to censor or exclude, never to complete a history
      (event table's unknown frame and cause; D243 dated block); extraction is brief 2. Brief 1 runs
      only tests and a Scope A smoke on fully synthetic event tables (3 data sets per case) into
      logs/t060-synthetic/; it reads no tracks and no H6 intermediate, only roles() metadata for ant
      counts.

The run is Scope A's V0 in full: scripts/scratch/t060/scopeA.ts --case all --sets 0:200 --par 10, fully synthetic event tables (only roles() ant counts read), output under logs/t060-synthetic/v0A; code as checked in D263 (reader.ts 01d574a3, scopeA.ts ca53b396).
- 2026-11-03 06:52 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-s0-brief2: acting — The extraction implements the unknown-history causes of D243's 06:51 block (focal gaps, blind frames, unbracketed and unseen tags, exits, onset status); no unknown history is made complete, counts by cause are output. Brief 2's runs: T060 tests, tsc, npm test, a Scope A determinism check and a Scope B smoke (synthetic, logs/t060-synthetic/ only), and the reproduction mode on real tracks, which builds event tables in memory and prints or writes only the reproduction values and the speed-bound shares (logs/t060-repro/).
- 2026-11-03 07:00 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: satisfied — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule. The commit (dca4a4a) holds the version first read, so this disposition for it stands; the block is reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-03 07:00 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-s0-brief1: satisfied — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule. It was appended after this run ended (D261, D263); the run was made against the version read, so this disposition stands. The block is gated under run:t060-s0-brief2.
- 2026-11-03 07:00 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-s0-brief1b: satisfied — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule.

- 2026-11-03 07:00 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for run:t060-v0-scopeA-20261103: satisfied — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule. The running Scope A V0 (synthetic event tables; reader.ts 01d574a3, scopeA.ts ca53b396) uses none of it, so this disposition stands.
- 2026-11-03 09:03 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): reviewed D265@78ad4ca2f334; D265 applies it: in Scope B every interval stays unknown by the blind-opportunity rule, none bridged or completed; the commitment still governs any empirical extraction (Q37), so it stays open
- 2026-11-03 15:22 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: satisfied — Re-read D243@ab96ad707023: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 15:18 UTC, the lead's details of the support-only audit after D266: a restricted support reader, the extraction in memory with no event table written, the colony-237 flag, the freeze, the stops). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (satisfied) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.

- 2026-11-03 15:25 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-q37-records-20261103: satisfied — The commit holds records only (git status: nothing under src/, scripts/, test/ or .claude/; backlog/ left out): T060's Stage 0 records D261-D266 with D243's dated blocks, X029, STATUS, and plied records (Q36, Q37, P175-P183, dispositions, notes, T037's message). D243's 15:18 block keeps every unknown history unknown (the extraction as checked in D265) and tag 52 conservative (D266); counts never complete a history.
