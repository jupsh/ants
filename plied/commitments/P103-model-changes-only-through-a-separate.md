## History
- 2026-10-31 02:17 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): created — D222: model changes after item 1(c) need their own design
- 2026-10-31 02:32 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): reviewed D223@d91126ff338b, D224@40e58b5e95b7; D224 restates it ('any model revision follows through a separate design'); D223 amendment 1 points to P103 in its reading. Open; no model change is in item 1(c)
- 2026-10-31 02:33 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-build-smoke: not-applicable — no model change: analysis scripts in scripts/scratch only
- 2026-10-31 02:57 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-data: not-applicable — no model change (D225: scratch analysis scripts only)
- 2026-10-31 02:57 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-read: not-applicable — no model change (D225: scratch analysis scripts only)
- 2026-10-31 03:09 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): reviewed D226@9b60eeb57b4b; D226's Next restates it: any model revision addressing slow coupling or post-entry activity is a separate design. No model change was made. Open
- 2026-10-31 03:23 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-second: not-applicable — no model change
- 2026-10-31 03:34 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for run:foragers1c-second: not-applicable — re-read D226 after its change: the change appends D228's result only (the independent check agrees); the check was a reproduction on existing records, so this commitment still does not bear on it
- 2026-10-31 03:35 UTC lead (session 6b5fb317): review for commit:partd-1b1c-20261031: satisfied — no model change is committed; D226 and D227 leave any revision to a separate design
- 2026-10-31 04:22 UTC lead (session 548cad34): reviewed D232@7e78fcc5a5c3; D232 lists P103 under Not in scope: the review changes no model and proposes no member; respected, not discharged
- 2026-10-31 04:23 UTC lead (session 548cad34): reviewed D231@68d492443f36; D231 cites D222 (P103's source) for the queen hypothesis H5 only; it proposes no model change, so P103 is respected, not discharged
- 2026-11-01 17:38 UTC lead (session f6ab21fd): reviewed D237@aeef03977adf; D237 read: the review runs nothing and changes no model; any check it proposes needs its own design. No change.
- 2026-11-01 18:21 UTC lead (session f6ab21fd): reviewed D237@2e84a192f41d, D238@7655ef093c1f; D237 (corrected) and D238 read: every proposed check needs its own design; nothing run or changed. No change.
- 2026-11-01 19:15 UTC lead (session f6ab21fd): reviewed D241@c351e62616d5; D241 (the H6 design) read against this; addressed in the design, open until it is approved and read.
- 2026-11-01 22:45 UTC lead (session f6ab21fd): reviewed D241@597483bc51a5, D242@95cc70c9ace0; D241 amendment 1 and D242 read: nothing here changes beyond what D242's commitments record.
- 2026-11-01 22:46 UTC lead (session f6ab21fd): review for commit:h6-design-20261101: not-triggered — The commit records the T061 inventory (D240), the H6 design and its amendment (D241), the user's answers (D242), F108's update and plied records; no model change, analysis, run or reading of new results.
- 2026-11-02 03:16 UTC lead (session 7b85e17e): reviewed D243@9fcd5b57058b; D243 makes no model change (not in scope); unaffected
- 2026-11-02 03:30 UTC lead (session 7b85e17e): reviewed D243@a5fef01895d5; D243 amendment 1 changes no model and simulates no model (Scope B's synthetic tracks are a test fixture); unaffected
- 2026-11-02 03:34 UTC lead (session 7b85e17e): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: satisfied — The commit records T060's design (D243 with amendment 1), the user's answer (D244), STATUS's pointer and plied records only; nothing is built, run, fitted or read; no model change: D243 keeps model changes out of scope (Scope B's synthetic tracks are a test fixture).
- 2026-11-02 05:55 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): review for commit:h6-design-20261101: not-triggered — Re-read D241@36eec164deeb: since the 597483 bytes this review read (the bytes committed in f9ad78f), only two blocks were appended, the lead's implementation details (onset rule, 25 mm radius, S1 sampling, runs, queens) and amendment 2 (D246). The commit holds the version read, so this disposition for it stands; the additions are reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-02 15:32 UTC lead (session 0e89af04): review for commit:h6-design-20261101: not-triggered — Re-read D241@07a71b62d68a: one dated line appended under amendment 2 (D249: the blind check's cutoff is the user's, either pooled or either zone share above 50 %, one zone flag printed) (and, since the 597483/2b609a47 pins, the lead's implementation details and amendment 2, reviewed at 05:5x UTC). The commit holds the version first read (597483), so this disposition for it stands; the later text is reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-03 00:05 UTC lead (session eac59010): review for commit:h6-design-20261101: not-triggered — Re-read D241@b1dd437cb8eb: one dated line appended (D259: the reader frozen, reader.ts and extract.ts SHA-256s, committed under scripts/frozen/h6/); no change to the design, the rules or any amendment. The commit holds the version it was gated on; the later text is reviewed at the next commit's gate (commit:h6-freeze-20261102).
- 2026-11-03 01:00 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for commit:h6-reading-20261103: not-triggered — No model change: nothing under src/ changes; D260 is a data-side reading.
- 2026-11-03 01:07 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: satisfied — Re-read D243@f25336a56aed: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 01:04 UTC, the lead's Stage 0 implementation details: order of two briefs, event table, near approach, triplets, matching cell, 0a, 0b likelihood and support, Scope A generator), filling gaps in amendment 1 without changing it. The commit (dca4a4a) holds the version read, so this disposition for it stands; the block is reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-03 02:21 UTC lead (session f6353347): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: satisfied — Re-read D243@e11041360645: amendment 2 appended (D262: 0b read as k-bar over a memoryless reference's median; V0 cases b2 and a-sparse added). The commit (dca4a4a) holds the version first read, so this disposition for it stands; the later text is reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-03 06:59 UTC lead (session 691f3fd9): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: satisfied — Re-read D243@514044e8ab40: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 06:51 UTC, the lead's brief-2 details: the colony's list, death records, blind frames, intervals and the sustained-onset rule, sensitivities, reproduction, speed-bound check, Scope B generator and scoring), filling gaps in amendments 1 and 2 without changing a threshold, label or acceptance rule. The commit (dca4a4a) holds the version first read, so this disposition for it stands; the block is reviewed at the next commit's gate.
- 2026-11-03 15:21 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: satisfied — Re-read D243@ab96ad707023: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03 15:18 UTC, the lead's details of the support-only audit after D266: a restricted support reader, the extraction in memory with no event table written, the colony-237 flag, the freeze, the stops). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (satisfied) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 15:25 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-q37-records-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds records only (git status: nothing under src/, scripts/, test/ or .claude/; backlog/ left out): T060's Stage 0 records D261-D266 with D243's dated blocks, X029, STATUS, and plied records (Q36, Q37, P175-P183, dispositions, notes, T037's message). No model change: T060 is a data-side observational design, and the audit (D243 15:18 block) changes no model.
- 2026-11-03 15:58 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-stage0-design-20261102: satisfied — Re-read D243@a0ceb72f78ab: one dated block appended since (2026-11-03, the support audit's code frozen: support.ts, extract.ts and their 26-file import closure copied byte-identical under scripts/frozen/t060/ with their SHA-256s; P172, D267, D268). It postdates this action and changes nothing it did or read, so the earlier disposition (satisfied) stands; the block is reviewed at the next action's gate.
- 2026-11-03 16:03 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-freeze-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds the T060 freeze and its records: scripts/frozen/t060/ (26 files, byte-identical to D243's freeze block SHA-256s; checked by sha256sum and by the frozen copy's colony-237 repro and synthetic pool, D243), D267, D268, D243's blocks, STATUS, and plied records (P184, P185, dispositions, notes). Nothing under src/ or test/; scripts/scratch/ and logs/ are not committed; backlog/ left out. No model change: T060 is a data-side observational design, and the audit (D243 15:18 block) changes no model.
- 2026-11-03 16:28 UTC lead (session e38b977a): review for commit:t060-close-20261103: not-triggered — The commit holds records only (git status: nothing under src/, scripts/ or test/; backlog/ left out): the T060 reading D269, F117, D270, T060's close and its commitment states, P186, T063, notes, STATUS. No model change.
